# NumCalc

This project, which was developed in Reactjs, consists in a numerical analysis calculator. This calculator allows the user to solve one variable equation,solve systems of linear equations and find an interpolating polynomial for a set of points. The calculator will provide the user with different answers depending on the algorithms used. Below you can see a list of all the algorithms implemented.

- Solving equations: Bisection Method, False Position Method, Multiple Roots Method, Newton Method.
- Solve system of equations: Cholesky Method, Doolittle Method
- Interpolation: Lagrange Polynomial Method, Newton Polynomial Method

All the algorithms were coded from scratch :)
